Find the number of employees who received the bonus and who didn't.
Bonus values in employee table are corrupted so you should use  values from the bonus table.
Be aware of the fact that employee can receive more than one bonus.
Output value inside has_bonus column (1 if they had bonus, 0 if not) along with the corresponding number of employees for each.

Tables: employee, bonus

SELECT has_bonus, COUNT(DISTINCT tble.ID)
FROM (
    SELECT
    e.id,
    CASE
        WHEN b.bonus_date IS NULL THEN 0
        ELSE 1
        END AS has_bonus
    FROM employee e
    LEFT JOIN bonus b
    ON e.id = b.worker_ref_id) AS tble
GROUP BY has_bonus
