Find the most profitable location.
Write a query that calculates the average signup duration and average transaction amount for each location,
and then compare these two measures together by taking the ratio of the average transaction amount and average duration for each location.

Your output should include the location, average duration, average transaction amount, and ratio. Sort your results from highest ratio to lowest.

Tables: signups, transactions

WITH avg_duration AS (SELECT
    location,
    AVG(signup_stop_date - signup_start_date) avg_signup_duration
FROM signups
GROUP BY 1),
avg_txn_amt AS (SELECT
    location,
    AVG(amt) AS mean_txn
FROM signups s JOIN transactions t
ON s.signup_id = t.signup_id
GROUP BY 1)
SELECT
    avg_duration.location,
    avg_duration.avg_signup_duration,
    avg_txn_amt.mean_txn,
    avg_txn_amt.mean_txn /  avg_duration.avg_signup_duration as ratio
FROM avg_duration JOIN avg_txn_amt
ON avg_duration.location = avg_txn_amt.location
ORDER BY 4 DESC
