\\
Find the cheapest and the most expensive variety in each region.
Output the region along with the corresponding most expensive and the cheapest variety.
Be aware that there are 2 region columns, the price from that row applies to both of them.

Note: The results set contains ties, so your solution should account for this.

For example in the event of a tie for the cheapest wine your output should look similar to this:


region             | most_expensive_variety | cheapest_variety
region_name | expensive_variety             | cheap_variety_1
region_name | expensive_variety             | cheap_variety_2
