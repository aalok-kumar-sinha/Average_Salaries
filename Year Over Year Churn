\\
Find how the number of drivers that have churned changed in each year compared to the previous one.
Output the year (specifically, you can use the year the driver left Lyft) along with the corresponding number of churns in that year,
the number of churns in the previous year, and an indication on whether the number has been increased (output the value 'increase'),
decreased (output the value 'decrease') or stayed the same (output the value 'no change').

    WHEN n_churned_prev > n_churned THEN 'decrease'
    WHEN n_churned_prev < n_churned THEN 'increase'
    ELSE 'no change'
