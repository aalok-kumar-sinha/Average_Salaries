\\
Write a query that returns a list of the bottom 2% revenue generating restaurants.
Return a list of restaurant IDs and their total revenue from when customers placed orders in May 2020.

You can calculate the total revenue by summing the order_total column.
And you should calculate the bottom 2% by partitioning the total revenue into evenly distributed buckets.

Table: doordash_delivery
\\

SELECT restaurant_id, total_order
FROM
  (SELECT restaurant_id,
          sum(order_total) as total_order,
          ntile(50) OVER (
                          ORDER BY sum(order_total))
   FROM doordash_delivery
   WHERE customer_placed_order_datetime BETWEEN '2020-05-01' and '2020-05-31'
   GROUP BY restaurant_id) sq
WHERE ntile=1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
